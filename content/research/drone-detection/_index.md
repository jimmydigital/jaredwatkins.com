## Drone Detection Section — Steering Instructions

This section covers counter-UAS (C-UAS) detection as applied to **critical infrastructure protection**: identifying unauthorized surveillance drones and potential attack drones, with emphasis on systems deployable today.

### Editorial Focus

**Primary use case:** Protecting fixed critical infrastructure (power substations, water treatment, emergency shelters, data centers, government facilities) from unauthorized drone surveillance and armed drone threats.

**Key threat model:**
- Drones **with no direct RF control link** — fiber-optic tethered or pre-programmed autonomous waypoint flights (cannot be detected by RF monitoring)
- Compliant US drones broadcasting FAA Remote ID (detectable but low priority threat)
- Consumer/commercial drones with RF control (standard threat)

**Prioritize:**
- Open-source detection projects (software-usable today)
- Multi-sensor fusion systems that discriminate drones from birds
- Micro-Doppler radar as the primary detection method vs. alternatives
- Counter-drone-drone (interceptor drone) approaches
- Solutions deployable without DoD/federal authorization (note legal constraints)

**Important legal context for entries:** Under the FAA Reauthorization Act and current federal law, RF jamming and drone takeover (cyber) countermeasures are **only authorized for federal agencies** (DOD, DHS, DOJ, FAA, Secret Service). Critical infrastructure operators typically may only detect and track — not interdict — unless specifically authorized. Document this constraint in relevant entries.

# Drone Detection

A knowledge base on detecting unauthorized drones at critical infrastructure — power, water, emergency shelters, and secure facilities. Covers detection physics (micro-Doppler radar, RF, acoustic, optical), open-source tools, commercial hardware, and counter-drone-drone platforms.

**Scope:** Detection and classification systems usable today, with emphasis on drone-vs-bird discrimination and threats that assume no RF control link.
