Google map of Clearwire WiMax towers in Seattle.<!--more-->

I moved to an apartment in a part of town where there are no good wired internet options. It’s an area served by Broadstripe cable.. which has some of the worst reviews I’ve ever read for a provider. Their internet service is also priced high with metered bandwidth. So… lacking options I’ve decided to try Clearwire or just Clear as they are known now. Going by the coverage map for Seattle you would think it’s blanket coverage.. but we know that’s not really true. So.. this isn’t a perfect map since I don’t know the coverage footprint of each of these antenna points.. but it can give you a pretty good starting point for aligning directional antennas or determining if you should have coverage.
