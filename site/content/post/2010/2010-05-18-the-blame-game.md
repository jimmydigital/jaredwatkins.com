Maybe it’s just me… but don’t you find it odd that Obama can be so quick and certain to blame the oil spill on BP.. but can’t bring himself to link islamic terrorists to the many attempted attacks on our soil since he’s been in office?  Whatever this mental disorder is it appears to affect all the top whitehouse staff.. curious no?   Oh and lets not forget Emmanuel Goldstein George Bush… this guy must have really been cleverly evil for all the things he’s still getting blamed for.. a good 18 months since he was officially in office.  I wonder how much longer the big O is going to ride that horse. Soon Bush will morph into some mythic creature that is still reaching out from beyond retirement to keep our dear leader down and spoil all his well thought out plans.  I suppose if he didn’t exist Obama would have to invent him.
