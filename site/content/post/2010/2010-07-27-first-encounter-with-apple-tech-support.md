I’ve been using a mac laptop as my primary system for about 5 years now.  I’ve had this particular system for over two years and never had a problem until last week.  I use this system both at home and at work so it gets a good workout and is pretty important to what I do.  I had some sort of power issue last week that required some new hardware internally.  I dropped it off with them on thursday night and was able to retrieve it tonight.. a 3 business day turnaround.  For about $300 they fixed everything that was wrong… which in this case meant a new motherboard (which they call a logic board for some inexplicable reason) and even a new battery.  That’s a pretty good deal considering.  I was a little worried about the hard drive coming back in tact (they warned me it might not) but they didn’t replace it… so I’m right back up and running.   Having dealt with the support for other big name PC computer companies over the last several years I must say this was the best experience I’ve had so far.
