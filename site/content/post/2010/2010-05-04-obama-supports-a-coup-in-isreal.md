Since when do we go around trying to[ topple one of our allies][1]??

> Sources in the Obama Administration and the US Congress have confirmed to the Middle East Newsline that the White House and State Department have sought to destabilize Netanyahu’s government . . . the campaign sought to replace Netanyahu with opposition leader and former foreign minister Tsipi Livni.

> In April 2010, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, began a series of attacks on Netanyahu in the Israeli media. Indyk, a former assistant secretary of state under then-President Bill Clinton, has called for the toppling of Netanyahu while his right-wing partners accept a more pliant prime minister.

Unbelievable… simply stunning!  Our one true ally in the middle east and this regime administration is actively trying to get the head of state replaced with someone ‘*more pliant*‘.

On a completely unrelated note.. I can’t image why Obama is accused of using thuggish Chicago tactics to get what he wants… no idea at all.
