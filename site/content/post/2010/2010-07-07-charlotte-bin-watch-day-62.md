It was 62 days ago that I ask the city of Charlotte to take back their RFID tagged recycling bin.  I’m not going to play their game… which if you didn’t know involves tracking your participation in their money losing recycling program… and eventually fines.. and re-education about how to be eco friendly.  No thanks little brother.

Back when I [first posted about this][2] on May 6th (and scooped Taras army of research interns) I also [filled out the form][3] on the city web site to take the bin back.  I was given a ticket number… but I’ve not heard anything since. At some point in July I called and was told my request was still open but they hadn’t started picking them up yet.  So the program to use these new bins just started this week… and I’ve heard stories about the city ignoring a lot of requests for take backs.  So I called them again today… and discovered that my ticket had magically been deleted from their system… how interesting!  Darn those computer glitches.   So now they tell me it will be picked up sometime in the next two weeks and I’m supposed to leave it out in front of my house.

Tomorrow will be day 63 of the bin watch… at day 90 I might just take it down to city hall and drop it off myself.

Update:  Finally.. they picked up the bin a few days after my latest request.
