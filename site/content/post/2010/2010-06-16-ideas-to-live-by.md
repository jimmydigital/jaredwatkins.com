With all the swirl and finger pointing around the oil leak.. I thought it was a good time to revise a posting from a few years ago.

1.  People are stupid
2.  There are no authorities
3.  No one knows what’s going on
4.  No one is really in charge

There are exceptions of course… but I find that if you live your life with these ideas in mind you will, more often than not, make better decisions and be less confused by what’s happening around you.

If you don’t quite grasp what I mean… think of the following questions:

*   Are eggs good for you?
*   What will fix the economy?
*   How much water should you drink?
*   How does magnetism work?
*   Is cholesterol related to heart disease?

You may think you know the answers to these questions… but if you do a little research you will find there is still much debate from the ‘experts’ on all of them and that your perception of ‘fact’ is probably wrong. Certainty is a big word.. and if you are going to live your life as if you know the answers to these basic sorts of questions you might do well to check your assumptions… and your sources of information.
