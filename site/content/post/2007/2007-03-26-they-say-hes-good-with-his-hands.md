[![table](/pics/inline_floatingtable3-scaled.jpg "Floating table")](/pics/floatingtable3-scaled.jpg)

Being mainly a computer guy I’m very pleased with how this table came out.

<!--more-->I lost track of how much time I spent on it.. lets just say a lot. =] First attempted piece of furniture made without plans… sorta making it up as I went along and based on something I saw on tv a few years ago.

For my next trick.. a new computer desk.. already well underway. Will be complete with some 2 and 4 post rack space.. sporting a height adjustable main work surface and rigging for 3 flat screens. \*Update\* It’s done too!
