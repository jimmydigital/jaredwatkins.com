If you believe the problem is man made global warming and the solution is Cap and Trade… think again.  Like most everything the federal government does this effort is a day late and 500 billion dollars short.   Have you noticed how cold the winters have been lately and how mild the summers?  Real scientists have noticed too and they have been talking about it for a while now… not that you would notice if you listen to Obama or get your news from the major media.
