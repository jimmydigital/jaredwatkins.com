A good turnout at the first state level NC tea party. I see a few signs and pitchforks… but overall a peaceful gathering… speeches, music, cheering and clapping. The local media is keeping a low profile but I do see the channel 9 news van and someone from channel 3. I also see a few photographers working their way through the crowd.. interesting to see how this gets covered.  Sent via BlackBerry
