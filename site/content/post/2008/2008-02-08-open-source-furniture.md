In preparing to move I have sold off all my large woodworking tools (table saw, jointer etc) and am left with hand held power tools and my router table. A freind ask me to make them a utility table that had specific dimentions to fit into their new home office layout and this is what I came up with. I designed it in google sketchup and I present here the source files and pictures of the final product released under Copyleft GPL. Enjoy and please drop me a line if you build one of these.
