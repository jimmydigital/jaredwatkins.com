Here is a nice little utility that I put together and have been using for a while. If you use OSX and keep your contacts in the native Address Book application like I do.. and happen to have an Asterisk PBX… this will let you do a simple click-to-dial.

It should be easy enough to setup for just about anyone and installation instructions are included. I didn’t wirte it from scratch.. but assembled it from various code snippits I found scattered around the net. It’s very simple and even includes some basic security but I would suggest only running it on a private network just to be safe. It works well for me.. your mileage may vary.
