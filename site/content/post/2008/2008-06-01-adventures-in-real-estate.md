Well.. it only took about 7 months but my place is finally under contract<!--more-->

and I’ve had an offer accepted on a new place near downtown Charlotte. I feel naughty though… I ‘stole’ the new place from someone who had apparently made a low offer and was dragging their feet about accepting the sellers counter.
I started off about a year ago looking for a specific kind of rental property here.. a quad. I couldn’t find anything I liked.. so then I started looking for something in an appreciating area for me. I’ve learned a lot about real estate since then and I know Charlotte a whole lot better than when I started. There are some really nice areas here.. streets lined with multi-million dollar estates… other streets that are like driving through a private garden.. and unfortunately lots of others that have a very cookie cutter feel.
Assuming everything works out… I’ll be in one of the older historical neighborhoods in a house that was built in the early 40s. I’ll have a descent size place with plaster and hardwood… a proper workshop/garage in back.. and in bike riding distance to lots of small shops.. non chain restaurants.. and all that downtown has to offer.
