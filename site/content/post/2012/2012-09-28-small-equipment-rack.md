Racks for computer or other 19″ gear don’t have to be expensive.. but they usually are. I had a heavy 2U UPS and a few half-depth servers that I wanted to keep together so I built this little rack over a couple nights. It’s made using 3 each 8′ 2x4s and 8′ 1x4s along with some wood glue, wood screws, and some 1/4″ bolts to attach the rack rails to the frame. The [rails I picked up from Parts Express][3] and they give me 12U of rack space for equipment that hangs straight down. The whole thing is on wheels and is very sturdy once it’s all together. The equipment I have in there weighs about 120 pounds and it’s easy to roll around.
