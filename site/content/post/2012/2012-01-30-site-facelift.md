I’ve been working on giving the site a facelift lately.. trying to make it a little more ‘light’… how am I doing?  I’ll also be rotating in various photos I’ve taken in the page header.  I’ll try to stick to photos I’ve actually taken myself… maybe as an incentive to do more traveling. I’m also trying out apache alternatives.. first lighttpd with fastcgi then nginx.
