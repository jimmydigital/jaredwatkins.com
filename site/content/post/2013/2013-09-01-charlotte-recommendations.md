I lived in Charlotte for a good long while... so here is a small list of my recommendations for businesses
I'd come to know and trust. If you think I've forgotten to include you please let me know.

*	If you need a real estate agent for personal or investment property talk to [Brenny Thompson][6]

*	For help finding contractors I preferred [Hocoa][4] I always had good experiences from their suggestions.

*	For lawn care around downtown I liked Kevin at [magnolialandscape.com][1]<!--more-->

*	For solar energy or hot water or rainwater systems go to [Energy Wise Solutions][8]

*	For any sort of advertising, photography or graphic design talk to Kat at [Paragon Studios][9]

*	Tree issues/removal I had a good experience with Landman's Tree Service 704 995-3473

*	For car detailing and glass tinting I like Brian at [Exclusive Detail][10]

*	For general car repair talk to Mikea at [Almar Auto][7] in southend

*	For guns and home safes I did a lot of business with [Hyatt Guns][2]

*	For a good range I preferred [Shooters Express][3] (ignore the totally 90s website)

*	If you need a barber talk to O'mar at [No Grease Barber][5] (at the Arena location downtown)
