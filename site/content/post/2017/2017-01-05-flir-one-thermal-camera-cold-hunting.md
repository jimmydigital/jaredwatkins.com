title: Hunting cold spots with the Flir One Thermal Camera
---

[![Thermal image of kitchen windows](/pics/inline_thermal_kitchenWindow.jpg#floatright)](/pics/thermal_kitchenWindow.jpg)

I like sharing useful gadgets with people and having an inexpensive thermal
camera around the house can be very useful at times.

I've been in the new house for about six months now and with the cold snap
making it in the mid 30s outside I thought this is a good time to break out
the [Flir One][1] thermal camera and see what I can find around the house.

I've noticed certain rooms just feel cold and I think it's from the older
windows but I'm not sure how bad they are or if there is anything else
going on behind the walls. From doing a little research I found that double
glazed windows should have around an 8 degree C temperature difference to the
interior walls under ideal conditions. This depends on the outside temperature
but that's a good ballpark.  For single glazed windows this could be 20C and
for triple glazed 4C. That's the surface temperature of the glass vs the walls
and does not take air leaks into account or the conductivity of the frame.

The windows in this house are mostly double pane with metal frames. The frames
are the coldest part.. easily visible in the images. Several windows also seem
to be leaking a lot of air on the bottom too and the front door also needs to
be better sealed from air leaks.

In these images of the ceiling you can see how the insulation is not uniform
above the vaulted ceilings leading to cold spots. The bright box in the corner is
a heating vent.

The camera can colorize the image in different ways.. here I have it hi-lighting
the coldest part of the image. In some of these I'm seeing
gaps in the insulation behind the walls... not so easy to fix but also small
enough that it's probably not a factor. The ceiling behind the fan is about 20
feet away and you can tell the image isn't as clear but you can still make out
where the ceiling joists are behind the drywall.

Using the camera is pretty straight forward. There's an app to install and the
thermal camera plugs into the bottom of your phone. It's powered by its own
rechargeable battery. It feels a little delicate hanging by the lighting plug and using
the rig pretty much requires two hands. It does seem to work pretty well
though.. and seems to be great for this sort occasional use around the house.
I did have to remove my phone from the Otterbox case I usually keep it in. I'm
using this with an iPhone but it's also available for Android phones or tablets.


Our cats are curious about what I'm up to. Notice how you can see the reflected
heat of the cat on the door it's standing next to. When using the camera around
reflective objects be careful about not catching a reflection of heat from
something nearby. You can even see your own body heat reflected in a window
when standing in front of it.

Other fun uses around the house... Image your power panel to see if any
circuits might be overloaded. Look at your gas grill to see exactly how and where
the heat goes for better control while cooking. It can also be useful to find
water leaks behind a wall.
