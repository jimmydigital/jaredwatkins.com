A few quotes come to mind when I think about what Ron Paul and the Tea Party ideals represent.  Churchill said: “You can always count on Americans to do the right thing – after they’ve tried everything else.”  It seems the media is once again attempting to pick the Republican candidate much as they did last time around with McCain. The media is trying to focus attention exclusively on Perry and Romney… which reminds me a lot of the bit from Futurama where the two clones John Jackson and Jack Johnson were vying for the presidency. Both of these guys represent the old guard of the republican party.. much as McCain did in 08.  This is not 08 though.. this time the stakes are much, much higher and I for one think it’s time to stop settling for the lesser two evils.. it’s time for something better.

The last 20 years or so has been dominated by bad policy coming from both parties.  I don’t blame the liberals for this… as surely as you can’t blame a snake for being a snake. It is what it is and you would be a fool for trusting it not to bite you. The republican party on the other hand is completely to blame. It has gotten so far away from its conservative roots as to be nothing but a shadow of its former self.  RINO isn’t just a label describing certain members of the party it defines the party as it exists today.   Regarding the current leadership I think it would be far easier to single out those to whom it does not apply.

We are told that Ron Paul is unelectable… yet the man has been winning elections in Texas since the 70s.  After getting his medical degree from Duke he got involved with politics over disagreements of economic policy and federal spending and his message has stayed consistent ever since.  Paul is the reason we had a limited audit of the Federal Reserve this year and found out [they provided 16 trillion][2] of OUR money to bailout banks and private businesses, many of them outside the US.  You would be forgiven for not knowing about that as the mainstream media has all but ignored the story.. much as they are going out of their way to ignore the current popularity of Ron Paul. In addition to doing very well in the recent debates, despite the [moderators trying to limit his participation][3], he just won the straw poll in CA.

Come November 2012 I don’t want to be pulling the lever for the lesser of two evils.  I don’t think as a country we can afford to keep compromising on the choice between the raging liberal on one hand and the slightly less liberal on the other. It’s time to give sound conservative ideas a chance again. It’s time to turn back the tide against this American socialism that has been coming out both major parties.  It’s time to restore the ideals of personal liberty and fiscal responsibility.  Surely it’s time for something better.. lets put Ron Paul at the top of the ticket and give the voters a real choice next time around.
