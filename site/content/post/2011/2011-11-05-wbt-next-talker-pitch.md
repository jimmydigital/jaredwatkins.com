The local news talk radio station is having a contest where the winner gets to host their own weekly show.  It’s only two hours a week on sunday night.. but it sounded like something that might be fun. So this is my entry. It was recorded and mixed with the open source [Ardour][1] digital workstation and the [Jack][2] audio sub system under OSX.
