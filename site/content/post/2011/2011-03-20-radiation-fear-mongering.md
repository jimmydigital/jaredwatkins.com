With all the fear mongering about radiation exposure in media lately I thought it would good to get a little clarity. I found this great chart that breaks down the normal levels of exposure we all get in everyday life and compares it with what’s going on in Japan.. and what happened with the other two major reactor incidents from history. So far.. it’s really not as bad as everyone in the media is making it out to be.  I keep hearing about these ‘worst case’ scenarios that are less and less likely as time goes by.. but I guess that doesn’t sell papers nearly as well.
