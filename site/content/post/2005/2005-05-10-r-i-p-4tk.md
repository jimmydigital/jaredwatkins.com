They hauled off the wreckage of N714TK the other day… this was the plane I did most of my primary flight training in.

<!--more-->I was [there ][2]when it happened too… waiting for the guy before me to return from a cross country flight. This has been just one of many setbacks and delays in my efforts to earn a private pilots license. At this point I’m a few weeks away from the check ride if all goes well. Since I’ve been sick and unable to fly I’ve been hitting the books again… there is a ton of info you are expected to keep in ‘[working Memory’][3] and with my knowledge test pushing 4 months ago this is proving difficult. As long as this road has been… it’s definitely worth it. I hope to start working on an [instrument rating][4] soon after getting the private.
